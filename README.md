vor_fast.py and vor_fast_Setup.py are provided from William Seviour's Github page (wseviour) and are installed by SSW_finder.py to calculate the vortex moments. If you use the vortex moments code please cite:

NAO_euclid_ditance.py proceses daily NAO timeseries from CMIP6 and reanalysis. It processes the timeseries to calculate the Euclidean distances.
fig9.py Example code to produce figure 9
NAO_correlations.py calucaltes corelation coefficients, effective sample size and the significance of the correlations based on effective sample size.
